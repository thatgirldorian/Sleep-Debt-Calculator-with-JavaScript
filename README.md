# Sleep-Debt-Calculator-with-JavaScript

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>

Everyone needs sleep. If we don’t sleep enough, we rack up something called 'sleep debt'. This is a JavaScript program that calculates if you’re getting enough sleep each week.

It will: 

- determine the actual amount of sleep you have gotten the past week
- also tell the ideal hours of sleep for each night of the past week
- will calculate, in hours, how much sleep you owe
